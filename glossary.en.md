# Dependencies

A software often use open source libraries.  These libraries are
called "dependencies".  This website allows you to browse
dependencies.  Only *production* dependencies are considered, and only
those who are required by two or more repositories.

<a id="fork"></a>
# Fork

A "forked" repository is repository derived from another one.

<a id="lib"></a>
# Library

On [code.gouv.fr](https://code.gouv.fr/#/libs), a library is a set of
functions packaged and distributed on a specific platform,
e.g. https://npmjs.com.

<a id="license"></a>
# License

A software licence is a contract between a software's authors and its
end-users.  So-called "libre" licences grant licensees permission to
distribute, modify and share a software's source code.

<a id="orga"></a>
# Organizations and groups (GitLab and GitLab)

GitHub allows to have personal accounts or "organizations accounts" to
store source code.  A "group" is the more or less equivalent notion
used on GitLab instances.  A public sector organization may have one
or more organization accounts and/or groups on one or several software
forges.

<a id="public-sector"></a>
# Public Sector

Source code developed by a public agency must be published, under
certain conditions.  This website offers the possibility to search
within source code repositories that are identified as coming from
public sector organisms.  It has been developed by
[Etalab](https://www.etalab.gouv.fr/).

<a id="sill"></a>
# Recommended free software

The list of recommended free software for the French public sector is
build by public agents on https://sill.code.gouv.fr.

See [this page](sill.md) (in French).

<a id="repo"></a>
# Repository

A "repository" is a place where source code files are stored.  This is
what you see when you browse a link to a source code as hosted on a
software forge.  This is also what you copy on your machine to explore
it locally.

<a id="reuse"></a>
# Reuses

GitHub allows to get the number of repositories that depend on another
repository: the number of "dependants" is listed here in the "Reuse"
column of the list of repositories.

<a id="papillon"></a>
# Services

[code.gouv.fr](https://code.gouv.fr/#/services) displays a list of
services relying on free software and accessible to public agents.

<a id="swh"></a>
# Software Heritage

[Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org) is a project
which ambition is to collect, preserve, and share all software that is
publicly available in source code form.  Each repository here
referenced is linked to its corresponding Software Heritage archive
version.

<a id="source-code"></a>
# Source code

A software's source code is what a developer writes.  Source code can
be just a few lines or quite a few of them. Source code can be made
available under a free licence for others to freely distribute, modify
and share.

<a id="stars"></a>
# Stars (GitHub and GitLab)

Stars allow users to mark a repository as favourite.  At the moment,
we collect repository favouriteness data from GitHub, Gitlab and
instances thereof.  Favouriteness is not a source code quality metric.

<a id="tag"></a>
# Tag

In a Git source code repository, a tag is a label attached to a
commit.  The tag can be annotated or not.  A tag generally signals 
a new release of the source code.

[code.gouv.fr](https://code.gouv.fr/#/tags) liste tags from
repositories containing a `publiccode.yml` file, a `CONTRIBUTING.md`
file or from which are published
[libraries](https://code.gouv.fr/#/libs).
