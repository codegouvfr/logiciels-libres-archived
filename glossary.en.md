## Source code

A software's source code is what a developer writes.  Source code can
be just a few lines or quite a few of them. Source code can be made
available under a free licence for others to freely distribute, modify
and share.

## License

A software licence is a contract between a software's authors and its
end-users. So-called "libre" licences grant licensees permission to
distribute, modify and share a software's source code.

## Repository

A "repository" is a place where source code files are stored.  This
is what you see when you browse a link to a source code as hosted on a
software forge.  This is also what you copy on your machine to explore
it locally.

## Organizations and groups

GitHub allows to have personal accounts or "organizations accounts"
to store source code.  A "group" is the more or less equivalent
notion used on GitLab instances.  A public sector organization may
have one or more organization accounts and/or groups on one or several
software forges.

## Reuses

GitHub allows to get the number of repositories that depend on another
repository: the number of "dependants" is listed here in the "Reuse"
column of the list of repositories.

## Dependencies

A software often use open source libraries. These libraries are called
"dependencies". This website allows you to browse dependencies.
Only *production* dependencies are considered, and only those who are
required by two or more repositories.

## Fork

A "forked" repository is repository derived from another one.

## Stars

Stars allow users to mark a repository as favourite. At the moment, we collect repository favouriteness data from GitHub, Gitlab and instances thereof. Favouriteness is not a source code quality metric.

## Public Sector

Source code developed by a public agency must be published, under
certain conditions.  This website offers the possibility to search
within source code repositories that are identified as coming from
public sector organisms.  It has been developed by
[Etalab](https://www.etalab.gouv.fr/).

## Software Heritage

[Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org) is a project
which ambition is to collect, preserve, and share all software that is
publicly available in source code form. Each repository here
referenced is linked to its corresponding Software Heritage archive
version.
