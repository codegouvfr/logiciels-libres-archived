title: Why Etalab's Free Software pole uses SourceHut
toc: false

To publish its source code, each French public agency can pick up one
of the options listed in the [open source contribution policy for the
public
sector](https://disic.github.io/politique-de-contribution-open-source/introduction.en.html),
published in May 2018 and that will be updated in 2022.

[These figures from code.gouv.fr](https://code.gouv.fr/#/stats) are
telling: most agencies choose to publish on GitHub.  Many others use
GitLab, either via gitlab.com or via a local instance.

**At Etalab, the Free Software unit publishes most of its source code
on [SourceHut](https://sourcehut.org).  Why?**

As shown in [this
list](https://github.com/etalab/etalab/blob/master/logiciels-libres.md#les-logiciels-libres-utilis%C3%A9s-par-etalab),
Etalab has long been committed to using free software: it's mainly
this commitment that decided the Free Software unit to use SourceHut
to publish most of its source code.  It's also to demonstrate that
there are other forges than the ones usually considered, by default or
by habit, and thus encourage each agency to motivate its choice for a
forge.

Here are the detailed reasons that guided our choice:

- Sourcehut is [entirely free
  software](https://sr.ht/~sircmpwn/sourcehut/).

- Among 100% free software forges, SourceHut is the only one proposing
  both continuous integration and mailing lists.

- If you want to contribute to a project, you don't need to create an
  account on SourceHut: an email address is enough to send patches and
  to share ideas.
  
- SourceHut don't collect any data from its users.

**This choice is not intended to be imposed on other
administrations**, not even to all of our projects, because
contributing via SourceHut may require an effort to adapt.  But it
reflects the principles we stick to, and we hope it will allow you to
discover this forge.
